To create a calculator server with Node.js on port 8000, we will need the following files:

1. `package.json`: This file will contain the project metadata and dependencies.
2. `server.js`: This file will be the entry point of our application. It will create an HTTP server and define the routes for our calculator operations.
3. `calculator.js`: This file will contain the Calculator class with methods for different mathematical operations.

Let's start with the `package.json` file. This file will contain the project metadata and dependencies. We will use the `express` package to create our server and define routes.
